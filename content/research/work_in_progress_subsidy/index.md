##### Abstract

I exploit the variation among potential primary school graduating cohorts by taking advantage of a subsidy given to girls to attend secondary school in Benin starting from 2010. I investigated the effect of the policy on Educational outcomes. Preliminary findings suggest that the policy increases primary school completion by 6 percentage points and increases grade 7 enrolment (secondary school) of 5 percentage points.
