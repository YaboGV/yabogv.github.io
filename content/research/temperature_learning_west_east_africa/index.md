##### Abstract

In this paper, we combine georeferenced temperature data with newly released learning data from 8 West and Central African (WCA) countries in the Programme on the Analysis of Education Systems (PASEC). In the first part of the paper, we provide benchmark estimates of the effect of high temperatures on learning outcomes in WCA, thus providing an important comparison point with other parts of the world. We find preliminary evidence of a temperature-learning gradient with higher temperatures associated with worse math and reading scores for students in our sample. In future analyses, we plan to explore heterogeneity in the association between heat and learning outcomes based on country, age, socioeconomic background, gender, and school quality. We also plan to explore the mechanisms linking temperature to learning by looking at child labor and hunger outcomes, and exploring whether results change if we restrict to temperatures during school vs. non
school days (i.e weekends and vacations) or growing season vs. non growing season.
